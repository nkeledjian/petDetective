# petDetective

petDetective is a user-friendly web application to help pet owners locate lost pets. 

The site allows pet owners to search the database of pets by their name by clicking on the "Pet's search" button as well as create a post advertizing their search based on the location that the pet was seen last. 

Users can click on the dropdown menu and navigate to the "report a lost pet" or "report a found pet" page. Both pages provide a form to fill out identifying information of the pet along along with a built in photo uploader to associate a picture with their post.

Once a user submits a post, a notification will pop up to indicate to the user that their post has been added to the database. Now the post will be visible on the "Look through posts" page, where all lost and found posts are located.

Future: paypal functionality to provide rewards to those who found a lost pet, login/authentication, and an upgraded photo uploader
